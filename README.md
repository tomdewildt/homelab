This repository contains the configuration for my home lab servers and network.

# How to run

Prerequisites:
* vagrant version ```2.2.7``` or later
* ansible version ```2.8.5``` or later
* ansible-lint version ```4.2.0``` or later

### Remote

1. Run ```make run/remote``` to execute the playbook.

### Virtual

1. Run ```make vm/start``` to start the virtual machines.
2. Run ```make run/virtual``` to execute the playbook.

Run ```make vm/stop``` to stop the virtual machines and ```make vm/remove``` to remove them.

# Goals

The primary goals of this project are...

* to have a highly-available home lab, with no SPOF (Single Point of Failure)
* to have a production grade kubernetes cluster.
* to learn and have fun.

# In summary

I have 4 physical machines plugged into 1 switch. One server is used as a router/gateway, this server handles the IPv4 NAT, VLAN, DHCP, DNS and VPN. The other machines are used in a kubernetes cluster with one master and two workers.

I have one APC UPS that handles all the power for the system. It keeps all the gear running during a power outage. When the battery hits a critical level all the servers are gracefully shutdown using ```apcupsd```.

# Gear

### Servers

* 2x [Dell PowerEdge R210 II](https://www.dell.com/ky/business/p/poweredge-r210-2/pd)
  * Intel Xeon X3460
  * 8GB RAM (DDR3-1333)
  * OS: 250GB 3.5 SATA HDD
  * Dell Power Supply 250W
* 2x [Dell PowerEdge R710](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/work/shop/cty/dell-poweredge-r710-rack-server/spd/poweredge-r710)
  * 2x Intel Xeon X5570 or 2x Intel Xeon X5560
  * 48GB RAM (DDR3-1333)
  * OS: 6x 300GB 3.5 SAS HDD in RAID 5
  * 2x Dell Power Supply 870W

### Switches

* 1x [Dell PowerConnect 5424](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/powerconnect-5424-switch/spd/powerconnect-5424)

### Other

* Old HP monitor
* Old Dell keyboard and mouse combo

### Power

The whole setup including all servers and switches draws about 530 watts idle.

* 1x [Dell Smart-UPS 3000VA](https://www.dell.com/en-my/shop/dell-smart-ups-3000va-lcd-rm-ups-2700-watt-3000-va-dlt3000rmi2u/apd/a7522112/power-cooling-data-center-infrastructure)

### ISP

* [Ziggo Zakelijk](https://www.ziggo.nl/zakelijk/)

# Software

* [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) is the most popular, open-source firewall operating system based on FreeBSD.
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

# Config

### Network config

* LAN is unused
* VLAN10 ```10.10.0.0/24```, is used for infrastructure (routers, switches, ups, etc).
* VLAN20 ```10.20.0.0/24```, is used for servers.
* VLAN30 ```10.30.0.0/24```, is used for management.
* VLAN40 ```10.40.0.0/24```, is used for DMZ services that need to be exposed to the internet.
* VLAN50 ```10.50.0.0/24```, is used for trusted clients.
* VLAN60 ```10.60.0.0/24```, is used for untrusted clients.

The VPN runs on the ```10.70.0.0/24``` subnet and the virtual cluster network for kubernetes on the ```10.80.0.0/16``` subnet.
